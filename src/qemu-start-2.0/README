qemu-start is a small program that helps you start qemu in a safe and
useful way. It has the following features:
  * Start qemu as a non-privileged user
  * Run qemu as a non-root user
  * Propegates xauth information
  * Only selected users can start qemu
  * Existing tap network devices can be bound

It presumes all qemu instances will run under the same user-id (qemu). A group 
emulator is created; only members of this group are allowed to start qemu. Qemu
is started with one ethernet interface, which is bound through a tap device.
Xauthority data is automatically transferred if the DISPLAY variable is set.


USING THIS PACKAGE
==================

Add any users that may start qemu to the emulator group.
Create a tap-device, like described in the manual page or in some other
way.
Now you are ready to call qemu-start.
If you have a DISPLAY variable set, the xauth key will be imported into
the .Xauthority file of the qemu user. That means it will be able to
display qemu on your X display.


NON-DEBIAN SYSTEMS
==================

This package is somewhat Debian-centric. It might still be useful if you
use some other distribution, though. You will have to create a
group emulator, and a user qemu yourself. The qemu user does not need a 
password, and /bin/false is a good shell. Afterwards, compile the package
by calling `make' and install it by calling `make install'.
